Little Meme. Big Dream. Welcome to InuGami
Inu Gami was created in July 2021 with the goal of being a decentralized meme project with true purpose.
InuGami’s mission is to bring popular cryptocurrency concepts to the mainstream. Unlike older, comparable projects, InuGami introduces holders to next-gen concepts such as Staking, NFTs, decentralized exchanges, and more.
The Inu Gami project includes...
$InuGami TOKEN
An ERC20 meme token that fosters and promotes healthy and widespread usage and decentralization of the project through a
specific reward linked Staking and NFTs.
It’s a kind of automagic ;-)
$InuGami NFTs
Coming in August 2021, is the official InuGami
community’s NFT decentralized
marketplace - $InuGami tokens can be staked (locked) in order to receive exclusive NFT rewards and digital collectibles featured by artists that are themselves part of the InuGami community.
Inu Gami will foster participation in regular contests for artists to showcase their work and have the community vote on which should be added to the marketplace.
